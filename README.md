## Introduction

This Generative AI Chatbot application leverages Google Generative AI to provide intelligent and context-aware responses to user queries. The app is built using Streamlit for the web interface and integrates various libraries for enhanced functionality, including text processing, PDF handling, and more.

## Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Integration with Google Generative AI for generating responses.
- Supports PDF processing and content extraction.
- Uses LangChain for managing and processing text inputs.
- Utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity search.
- Environment variable management with python-dotenv.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **Google Generative AI**: For generating responses.
- **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables.
- **LangChain**: For handling and processing text data.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **ChromaDB**: For storing and managing embeddings.
- **pdf2image**: For converting PDF pages to images.
- **faiss-cpu**: For efficient similarity search.
- **langchain_google_genai**: For integrating LangChain with Google Generative AI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- google-generativeai
- python-dotenv
- langchain
- PyPDF2
- chromadb
- pdf2image
- faiss-cpu
- langchain_google_genai

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-ai-chatbot.git
    cd generative-ai-chatbot
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:

    ```sh
    pip install streamlit google-generativeai python-dotenv langchain PyPDF2 chromadb pdf2image faiss-cpu langchain_google_genai
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   
    Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add your Google Generative AI API key:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).
